  EUROPEAN POLITICAL TECH LANDSCAPE – STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO EDITING THE MAP
================================================================================

This guide explains how to change anything in the map data: add companies,
edit logos, change categories, update descriptions, and publish changes using
Excel and GitHub Desktop. No coding or Python required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: INITIAL SETUP (DO THIS ONCE PER COMPUTER)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.1  Install Node.js (if not already installed)
        - Go to https://nodejs.org
        - Download and install the LTS version
        - This is needed to run the "Update map" step

Step 1.2  Create a GitHub account (if you don’t have one)
        - Go to https://github.com and sign up

Step 1.3  Install GitHub Desktop
        - Go to https://desktop.github.com
        - Download and install GitHub Desktop
        - Sign in with your GitHub account

Step 1.4  Get access to the map repository
        - The repo owner must add you as a collaborator
        - You will receive an email or see the repo in your GitHub account

Step 1.5  Clone the repository to your computer
        - Open GitHub Desktop
        - File → Clone repository (or use the repo URL you were given)
        - Choose a folder (e.g. Documents) and clone
        - This creates a folder with all the map project files

Step 1.6  Run the one-time setup for the map
        - Open the project folder (the one you cloned)
        - Double-click:
            • Setup.command   (on Mac)
            • Setup.bat       (on Windows)
        - Wait until it says "Setup complete"
        - You only need to do this once (or after pulling big updates)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: MAKING CHANGES IN THE EXCEL FILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2.1  Open the data file
        - In the project folder, find the file:  map_data.xlsx
        - Double-click to open it in Microsoft Excel (or another spreadsheet app)

Step 2.2  Understand the columns
        - S. No.          Row number (use the next free number for new rows)
        - Entity          Company or organisation name
        - Logo            Full URL of the logo image
                          Example: https://eptl.vercel.app/logos/example-com.png
                          Naming: use the company website domain, replace dots
                          with hyphens, add .png  (e.g. example.com → example-com.png)
        - HQ              Headquarters country
        - Domain          Company website URL (e.g. https://example.com/)
        - Description    Short one-line description
        - Category       Main category (must match exactly; see list below)
        - Sub Category   Subcategory (must match others in that category)
        - Tools/Products Optional; leave blank if not needed
        - Hub URL        Optional; only for companies with a Partisan Hub profile

Step 2.3  Allowed categories (use exactly as written)
        - Research & Intelligence
        - Strategy & Creative Production
        - Field & Mobilization
        - Campaign Management & CRM
        - Fundraising & Payments
        - Organisational Infrastructure
        - Digital Comms & Advertising
        - Participation & Election Tech
        (Subcategories must match existing ones in that category; look at other
         rows in the same category for the correct wording.)

Step 2.4  Add a new company
        - Go to the next empty row
        - Fill in S. No. (next number), Entity, Logo, HQ, Domain, Description,
          Category, Sub Category
        - Leave Tools/Products and Hub URL blank unless you have the information

Step 2.5  Edit an existing company
        - Find the row with that company (use Entity or Domain)
        - Change any cells you need (logo URL, description, category, etc.)
        - If the company appears in more than one category, it will have more
          than one row; edit each row as needed

Step 2.6  Change a logo
        - Find the company row(s)
        - Update the Logo column with the new full URL
        - Logo files live in the project’s public/logos/ folder; the URL format
          is: https://eptl.vercel.app/logos/filename.png  (or your deployment URL)

Step 2.7  Remove a company from the map
        - Delete the entire row for that company
        - If the company is in multiple categories, delete each of its rows

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3: SAVE THE EXCEL FILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3.1  Save your work
        - Mac:    Press Command + S   or   File → Save
        - Windows: Press Ctrl + S     or   File → Save

Step 3.2  Close Excel (optional)
        - You can leave it open or close it; the saved file is what matters
          for the next step

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 4: UPDATE THE MAP (REGENERATE THE MAP DATA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4.1  Run the Update map script
        - Open the project folder (same folder where map_data.xlsx is)
        - Double-click:
            • Update map.command   (on Mac)
            • Update map.bat       (on Windows)

Step 4.2  Wait for it to finish
        - A window will open and show messages
        - Wait until you see: "Done. Open GitHub Desktop, commit the changed
          files, and push to publish."

Step 4.3  If you see an error
        - "Node/npm not found" → Install Node.js (see Step 1.1)
        - "dependencies missing" → Run Setup again (Step 1.6) or open Terminal/
          Command Prompt in the project folder and run:  npm install

Step 4.4  Close the Update map window
        - Press Enter (or click) to close the window when you are done reading it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART 5: GITHUB DESKTOP – COMMIT AND PUSH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5.1  Open GitHub Desktop
        - Open the GitHub Desktop application
        - Make sure the current repository is the map project (use the menu
          to switch repository if you have more than one)

Step 5.2  Check the changes
        - You should see changed files, typically:
            • map_data.xlsx
            • public/companiesV2.json
        - Click each file to see what changed (optional)

Step 5.3  Write a commit message
        - In the bottom-left box, type a short description of what you changed
          Examples:
            "Add Acme Corp to Campaign Management & CRM"
            "Update logo and description for Company X"
            "Remove Company Y from the map"

Step 5.4  Commit the changes
        - Click the blue  Commit to main  button (or "Commit to [branch name]")
        - The changes are now saved in your local copy of the project

Step 5.5  Push to GitHub
        - Click  Push origin  (top right, or in the main window)
        - This uploads your commit to GitHub so others can see it and the
          live map site can update

Step 5.6  If you see "divergent branches" or "Pull" is offered
        - Someone else (e.g. a collaborator) has pushed changes since you
          last pulled
        - Click  Pull  first (or use the menu: Branch → Pull)
        - Wait for the pull to finish; fix any conflicts if asked
        - Then click  Push origin  again

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK REFERENCE – FULL SEQUENCE AFTER SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Open map_data.xlsx in Excel.
  2. Add or edit rows (companies, logos, categories, etc.).
  3. Save the Excel file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S).
  4. Double-click "Update map.command" (Mac) or "Update map.bat" (Windows).
